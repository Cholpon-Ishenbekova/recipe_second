The Recipe Collection Application is a web-based tool designed to manage and interact with a collection of recipes. This project integrates both traditional sorting techniques (Decision Tree Algorithm) and modern AI-powered search (using embeddings and cosine similarity) to enhance recipe discovery and management. The goal of this report is to provide an overview of the application, its features, implementation, and results.
