The Recipe Collection Application is a web-based tool designed to manage and interact with a collection of recipes. This project integrates both traditional sorting techniques (Decision Tree Algorithm) and modern AI-powered search (using embeddings and cosine similarity) to enhance recipe discovery and management. The goal of this report is to provide an overview of the application, its features, implementation, and results.

Objectives
1.	Fetch and manage recipes from a JSON file hosted on a remote server.
2.	Allow users to select recipes for further processing.
3.	Generate shopping lists based on selected recipes.
4.	Implement AI-powered search using embeddings and cosine similarity for enhanced recipe matching.
